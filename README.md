# DESIGNDROP
<p>Stream Four Project: Full Stack Frameworks with Django - Code Institute<p>

<p>This site is for a Graphic design Agency, DEISGNDROP.

showing the creators previous work as inspiration for companies that needed branding/services for their company.

# Demo 

A live demo can be found [here]().

# UX

<p>
To make the system/site as clear as possible to the end-user, a basic but modern, clean design has been implemented. 
Options are limited and the end-user will not be overloaded with options to do anything other than the bare minimum. 
The navigation bar, buttons, cart system and dashboard have been built and have an easy to understand logic, So that a user can 
use this site free of worry or confusion.

# User stories

With years of Graphic design experience, we have built a well-known form and work ethic in creating designs. 
We asked our customers from day to day what they would like to see in a sample and came up with the following points:

* As a user, I want to easily fill in the forms for a service request
* As a user, I want to upload my artwork fast and easy in the same system
* As a user, I want a secured overview of my order history (dashboard)
* As a user, I want the system to remember my cart, for if I want to make changes later
* As a user, I do not want to fill in my details every time, but do want to change them if needed
* As an employee, I want to know which service are required per order
* As an employee, I want to change the status of an order
* As an employee, I would like to edit and upload new artwork
* As an employee, I want to search all orders

# Strategy

<p>
The goal of the system is to make it as easy as possible to access, short and informative,
while striving for a simple and user-friendly design. Whether the person using the system is an employee/client,
it will be easily navigated and layed-out for optimum use.
</p>

# Scope

<p>
For customers, we wanted to provide them with an easy to understand system. 
This way, they would be able to request services: faster, easier and on their own, 
so our studio employees have more  time to produce the designs that are being ordered daily.
This system is perfect for DESIGNDROP employees.
</p>

# Structure

<p>
The system is structured to get the right information as quickly as possible. 
The order of the options provided are placed in a logic workflow while the design provided will use a messages 
bar that should be easy to understand and gives the customer a straight away no-nonsense feedback. 
The Our Work section shows completed projects for previous clients. 
The contact section is there for people who need to know more information about the agency.
